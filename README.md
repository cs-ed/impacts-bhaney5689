# Impacts on Society

Computer Science is a high school, A-G qualifying course that I intend to teach within the next two years at the high school I am currently employed for.  The course has already been approved by the UC system to satisfy the A-G requirements.  Computer Science is a year long course, adapted from the extended TEALS Program curriculum, which is based off the renown CS10 course from UC Berkeley.  The first semester is an engaging course that explores a variety of basic computational thinking and programming concepts through a project-based learning environment.  Snap! is the coding tool used to explore the fundamental computer science topics, such as loops, abstractions, lists, and cloning. The second semester focuses on the use of Python 3, covering such topics as conditionals, functions, nested loops, music programming, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.  Both semesters end in a student-designed programming project.  All computer science principles will be analyzed through lenses of integration, concentration, historical, and social impacts.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Students will design and implement socially conscious tech startups to gain relevant and applicable computer science skills.
Students will create computer models which incorporate the principles of digital citizenship.
Students will analyze relevant computer science research to represent the relationship between humans, computers, and different fields of study.
Students will collaborate while making connections between computer science and social issues.


### Learning Activities

There will be weekly online discussions, which serve the purpose of promoting collaboration, current event awareness, digital etiquette, and self-reflection on topics both explicitly and less so on topics related to the overlap between student lives, computer science, and social issues.  Since class grades will be split between projects and discussions, reflections on social issues will account for roughly 50% of student grades.  As an example, one of the first prompts to respond to is "Describe both a positive and negative online experience involving social media.  For each, reflect on whether you believe the experience you had was common for students your age.  What evidence can you find?"  After responding to the prompt early in the week, students have the rest of the week to respond to two other student responses in an appropriate manner.

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
