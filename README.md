# Impacts on Society

Computer Science is a high school, A-G qualifying course that I intend to teach within the next two years at the high school I am currently employed for.  The course has already been approved by the UC system to satisfy the A-G requirements.  Computer Science is a year long course, adapted from the extended TEALS Program curriculum, which is based off the renown CS10 course from UC Berkeley.  The first semester is an engaging course that explores a variety of basic computational thinking and programming concepts through a project-based learning environment.  Snap! is the coding tool used to explore the fundamental computer science topics, such as loops, abstractions, lists, and cloning. The second semester focuses on the use of Python 3, covering such topics as conditionals, functions, nested loops, music programming, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.  Both semesters end in a student-designed programming project.  All computer science principles will be analyzed through lenses of integration, concentration, and social impacts.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
