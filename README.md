# Impacts on Society

Computer Science is a high school, A-G qualifying course that I intend to teach within the next two years at the high school I am currently employed for.  The course has already been approved by the UC system to satisfy the A-G requirements.  Computer Science is a year long course, adapted from the extended TEALS Program curriculum, which is based off the renown CS10 course from UC Berkeley.  The first semester is an engaging course that explores a variety of basic computational thinking and programming concepts through a project-based learning environment.  Snap! is the coding tool used to explore the fundamental computer science topics, such as loops, abstractions, lists, and cloning. The second semester focuses on the use of Python 3, covering such topics as conditionals, functions, nested loops, music programming, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.  Both semesters end in a student-designed programming project.  All computer science principles will be analyzed through lenses of integration, concentration, historical, and social impacts.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Students will design and implement socially conscious tech startups to gain relevant and applicable computer science skills.
Students will create computer models which incorporate the principles of digital citizenship.
Students will analyze relevant computer science research to represent the relationship between humans, computers, and different fields of study.
Students will collaborate while making connections between computer science and social issues.


### Learning Activities

There will be weekly online discussions, which serve the purpose of promoting collaboration, current event awareness, digital etiquette, and self-reflection on topics both explicitly and less so on topics related to the overlap between student lives, computer science, and social issues.  Since class grades will be split between projects and discussions, reflections on social issues will account for roughly 50% of student grades.  As an example, one of the first prompts to respond to is "Describe both a positive and negative online experience involving social media.  For each, reflect on whether you believe the experience you had was common for students your age.  What evidence can you find?"  After responding to the prompt early in the week, students have the rest of the week to respond to two other student responses in an appropriate manner.

### Assessment

The rubric for the discussion will include the following requirements: critical analysis in their own response, participation in learning community, digital etiquette, and quality of writing.  This will ensure that discussions are thoughtful, collaborative, and inclusive. 

### Outcomes

The three signifcant ways this course will promote equity/inclusion are using an approachable software such as Snap!, incorporating significant collaborative student discussions and reflections, and implementing a project-based approach to the course.  Because of this, students will be able to reflect on computer science, their lives, and society. The course is also able to be run in a Title I rural high school, so access issues are accounted for.
